# S2-GNN-dev
Sparse Sobolev GNN (S2-GNN), employs Hadamard products between matrices to maintain the sparsity level in graph representations.
S2-GNN utilizes a cascade of filters with increasing Hadamard powers to generate a diverse set of functions.

We evaluate the performance of S2-GNN on multiple datasets, which include tissue phenotyping in colon cancer histology images, text classification of news, activity
recognition using sensors , recognition of spoken letters, as well as the commonly used node classification benchmarks Cora , Citeseer, Pubmed, and OGBN-proteins . 

These diverse datasets provide a comprehensive evaluation of S2-GNNâ€™s performance across different domains.
